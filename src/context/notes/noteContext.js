import { createContext } from "react";
const NoteContext=createContext();
export default NoteContext;

//in this project context api is used it has many benifits such as we can just declare a state once and use anywhere in the project , that means it removes the problem of props drilling (passing of props to each component )
//context is nothing but like a place to hold and store the states
